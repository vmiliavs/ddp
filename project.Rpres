Overview
========================================================

- This is an interactive tool for linear regression model selection.  
- It operates on mtcars dataset.
- The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).  
- See more details about the dataset in ***?mtcars***.  

Tool description
========================================================

- Variable selection is not a trivial task in building multivariable regression model.  
- This tool makes this task easier.  
- Just select what variables you want in the model and press ***Submit*** button.  
- Then see the model summary and diagnostics in the main panel.  

Example of Summary
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + qsec + am, mtcars)
summary(model)
```

Example of Diagnostics
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(model)
```
